# React Flux Users

* npm install
* npm run dev
* open in browser at  http://localhost:8080/

## Description:
Create a simple user management application using React and Flux.

### Acceptance criteria:
* Displays a list of users using JSX
* Can add and remove users
* Can update existing user information
* User info includes
* First name
* Last name
* Address
* Has a basic UI (something more than unformatted text on a screen)

### User data should be maintained in the store, and modified through actions. It does not have to persist outside of the application (no external JSON files or endpoints necessary).

### We’re looking for an understanding of:
* How to use React’s state and props
* The React and Flux lifecycles
* ES6 Javascript

#### The environment you use is up to you. Please make your code accessible through Git and be prepared to share it with the team.
